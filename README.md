## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular, and understanding their market dynamics can be crucial for investors and analysts. Clustering cryptocurrencies based on their price change patterns can provide valuable insights into their behavior and potential investment opportunities. In this notebook, we explore clustering techniques using K-Means and PCA to analyze cryptocurrency market data.

## Data Preparation <a name="data-preparation"></a>
We start by loading the cryptocurrency market data from a CSV file and performing data preprocessing steps such as normalization using StandardScaler.

## Original Data Analysis <a name="original-data-analysis"></a>
We analyze the original data by applying K-Means clustering algorithm to identify the optimal number of clusters (k). We plot the elbow curve to visualize the inertia values for different k values and determine the best value for k.

## PCA Analysis <a name="pca-analysis"></a>
Next, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and extract principal components. We compute the explained variance ratio to understand the contribution of each principal component to the total variance.

## Comparison and Visualization <a name="comparison-and-visualization"></a>
We compare the clustering results obtained from the original data with those from the PCA-transformed data. We visualize the elbow curves for both cases and analyze the impact of using fewer features on the clustering process.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
In conclusion, this notebook demonstrates the process of clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means and PCA techniques. By analyzing the clustering results and comparing different approaches, we gain insights into the market dynamics of cryptocurrencies and identify potential investment opportunities.
